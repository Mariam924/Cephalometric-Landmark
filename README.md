# Cepheo

Cepheo is an innovative DL driven online orthodontic and orthognathic platform for dental clinicians.


## Description

We developed a node.js and flask APIs connected to MongoDb database, through which we deployed the best model. It
automatically performs landmark positioning. It can be used as
an online diagnostic software that reduces the time and effort
of orthodontists involved in the orthodontic case and diagnosis.
